## Read me

This folder contains a data set derived from <a href="http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip/">http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net</a>, the script used to transform the data and a codebook describing the data set.

The script *GeetingData1_script.R* is mostly standalone. To get it working one only needs to make sure:

1. that the required libraries are installed and 
2. to change the calls to *setwd* to appropriate locations. 

This work has been as a course project in the Getting and Cleaning Data course on www.coursera.org.
